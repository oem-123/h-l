							<h2>Abstract</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I believe programming to be much more than just a way to make a computer work in the way you want it. The act of programming in itself is an art, a functional art, but an art nonetheless. As programmers, we are meant to find a solution that is easy to adapt, modify, and reuse and should never just think about making something "just work".

							Code is read more than written and what we write should not be black-boxed. Every line should be elegant and easy to read for anyone coming to view the code years from now. Before starting to write any code we should first attain to understand the problem and then furthermore try and break this problem down into subproblems.
							
							I see programming as understanding a problem well enough to be able to explain it as simple as possible to a machine and being able to be easily understood by anyone coming back to it. And in this sense I am an artist, Atom text editor is my canvas, Javascript is my paint, and each line of code I write is a testament to my artistic integrity. </p>
